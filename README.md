# Welcome to Database Management System

### Recap
The SQL syntax bassically has 3 parts
* Data Query language (DQL)
* Data Definition language (DDL)
* Data Manipulation language (DML)

*DQL involved querying a database for certain information and this was when we do things like **SELECT**, __JOIN__, **LIMIT** etc.*

## Database Normalization
This is basically a way to store data in a relational database so it can be worked with quickly and efficiently. So your database can be normalised or denomalized (Case when is messy and not very sustainable)

### Pitfalls of denomalized database
* Insertion anomaly
* Update anomaly
* Deletion anomaly
